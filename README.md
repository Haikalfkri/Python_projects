Welcome to my Python Projects repository! This collection contains a variety of fundamental Python projects that I’ve created while learning and practicing core programming concepts.

## 📁 Projects Included

Each project focuses on different aspects of Python programming such as:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control flow (if-else, loops)
- Functions and modules
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Simple algorithms and problem solving

> 📌 Each project is located in its own folder with source code and a description (where applicable).
